# Mikrotik Command Execution - Sample Commands File
# =============================================
#
# This file contains commands to be executed on Mikrotik routers.
# Each line represents a single command to run.
# Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# USAGE GUIDELINES:
# 1. Test commands on a single device before running on multiple devices
# 2. Place commands in order of execution priority
# 3. Use export commands to back up configurations before changes
# 4. For complex scripts, consider using :put to detect errors
#
# EXAMPLE COMMANDS:

# System information command - Read only and safe
#/system resource print

# Get device identity
#/system identity print

# Check device version
#/system package print

# Export current configuration (useful for backup)
#/export file=backup

# List all interfaces
#/interface print

# List DHCP leases
#/ip dhcp-server lease print

# List bridge configurations
#/interface bridge print

# List firewall rules
#/ip firewall filter print

# Example configuration change (commented out for safety)
# /interface bridge port set [find interface=wifi1] pvid=500

# Example for checking results with error detection
# :put [/interface get [find name="wifi1"] name]; :if ($name != "wifi1") do={ :put "ERROR: Interface wifi1 not found" }
